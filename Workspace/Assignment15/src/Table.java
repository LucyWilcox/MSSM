/*
Table creates a new instance of Player for both a player 
and a dealer. And a new instance of Deck. A user will open
the program to begin and is automatically given 2 cards.
At this point (I am not sure if this is how black jack with 
bets works) a the player will be prompted for a bet. Then 
allowed to hit or pass by choosing either 0 for pass or 1 
for hit. This continues until the both the player and deal
pass. After this the number closest without going over 21
will win the bet and the result of the game will me printed.
