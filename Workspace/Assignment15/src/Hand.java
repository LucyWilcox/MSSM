/*
 This class has an array of cards that are in hand. It will 
 have the ability to have cards added and check the total
 value. The add card method will be used by the player,
 actually it will all be used by the player. This will
 happen because the array cards is a field so it will hold
 all changes made in the class and then the array can be 
 use by the player
